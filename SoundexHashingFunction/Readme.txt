The solution contains following
1. Solution to convert text to soundex
2. Test solution for testcases(i came through some of this test cases on google)
3. Screnshots 


I have assumed following
1. The first letter  in soundex is always Capital
2. Havnt added any validation for input text except to check if they are empty
   Could think of following validations
     should we validate if string contains numbers!
     Spaces in the string?
     Alphanumeric Chars/Punctuation marks?
